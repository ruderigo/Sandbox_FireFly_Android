"""Offline Stumps showing online (Nov 9): a relay's remembered announce isn't hearing the Stump.

    python3 run_fresh_announce.py

Any Reticulum relay (every Stump) answers a path request with the last announce it passed on,
days later. FireFly counted that as hearing the Stump: online for 10 minutes (its announce),
35 (its beacon). Now:
  * an announce heard live counts, and so does the Stump's own answer to a path request;
  * a copy already seen doesn't; an older one than the last doesn't; one made long ago doesn't
    (when the Stump's clock is real);
  * a Stump restarted with its clock back near 2000 (a Heltec with no internet) still counts;
  * a replayed beacon doesn't make it online, and its old boot id isn't a restart.
